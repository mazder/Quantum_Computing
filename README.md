## Template Matching ##
Quantum circuits generated by cascading quantum gates and/or decomposing classical reversible gates are often non-minimal. An optimization method called template matching can be employed to reduce the number of quantum gates in a circuit. Quantum templates are derived from identity circuits. All minimal realizations, within certain limitations, are embedded into templates. Due to this property, templates matching has the potential to reduce quantum costs of circuits.
